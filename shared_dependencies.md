The shared dependencies between the files we are generating are:

1. **Next.js**: This is the main framework used for building the application. It is used in all the files for server-side rendering and routing.

2. **React**: Next.js is built on top of React, so React components and hooks are used throughout the application.

3. **TypeScript**: TypeScript is used in all the `.tsx` files for type checking and improved developer experience.

4. **CSS Modules**: CSS Modules are used in the `globals.css` and `Home.module.css` files for styling the components.

5. **Common Components**: The `Header.tsx` and `Footer.tsx` components are likely used in multiple pages of the application.

6. **Document and App Components**: The `_document.tsx` and `_app.tsx` files are special Next.js files that wrap around all pages. They likely share some common layout or state.

7. **Public Assets**: The `favicon.ico` and `vercel.svg` files in the public directory are likely used in multiple places in the application.

8. **Package.json**: This file contains the list of all dependencies used in the project, which are shared across all files.

9. **tsconfig.json**: This file contains the TypeScript configuration used across all TypeScript files.

10. **.next/config.js**: This file contains the Next.js configuration used across all Next.js files.
